Keshcarrigan Lough
Keshcarrigan lough (Irish: Ceis Charraig√≠n loch, meaning 'Kesh, or causeway, near the little rock, lake')[3] is a mesotrophic freshwater near Keshcarrigan village, in northwest Ireland.
Known for quality coarse fishing, Keshcarrigan lough allows bank fishing from concrete stands on the northern shore, two with wheelchair access.[1]
The ecology of Keshcarrigan lough, and other Leitrim waterways, is threatened by curly waterweed, zebra mussel, and freshwater clam invasive species.[4][5]
